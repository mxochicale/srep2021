Open terminar to play 
```
vlc 60bit-minute_for2secs.mp3 vlc://quit
```

Terminal for video recorder
```
cd ~/OpenFace/build/bin/
./Record
```

Terminal for video data 
```
cd && mkdir -p ~/tmp/imu/ && cd ~/tmp/imu

# Workflow for the experiment

1. Start ./Record to set the paper into the camera 
field and test the movement to constrain the less 
variablity in the star movement and stop record (q)

2. Turn on Sensor and Connect

3. ./RecordVIDEO

4. RecordMUSE: Start Recording DATA 

5. PLAY AUDIO: vlc 60bit-minute_for2secs.mp3 vlc://quit



6. PERFORM MOVEMENT



7. StopMUSE
 
8. StopVIDEORECORD: (q)
 
9. mv out.avi ~/tmp/imu/e??.avi 

10. Save MUSE DATA: e??.csv

11. Disconect Sensor

12. Preparapartion for the next experiment (Change the figure to follow)
