Dear Miguel

Sorry for the delay...  I have two comments:

1. at the end of the results section (before the Discussion) you should include a paragraph that summarises the main results;

2. it is still not clear what conclusions you can draw about the performance of the participants (in the experiment) or comparing human with humanoid. While I can see that the point of the paper is on the discussion of the different methods, and their usefulness, I still think it would be good to make observations on variability in the actual movement (what is the difference between human and humanoid?, do some people show more variability than others?) and then ask whether (as well as being sensitive to the data) some of the methods are more sensitive to variability in performance... 

These would be the only changes that need to be made and then the paper is in a good state to submit.

Best wishes
Chris
