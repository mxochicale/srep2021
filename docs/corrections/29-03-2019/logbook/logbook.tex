\item  (pp. 1)  \_$\wedge$  Not a conclusion just an observation

	\begin{verbatim}

Then with the use of RQA metrics, we find out that the type of 
movements and the level of smoothness affects those metrics. 
Specifically, entropy values from RQA were well distributed and 
presented variation in all the conditions for time series. 
This work have then the potential to enhance the development of 
better diagnostic tools for various applications in rehabilitation, 
sport science or for new forms of human-robot interaction.
