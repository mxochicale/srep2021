# Cover letter
Authors should provide a cover letter that includes the affiliation and 
contact information for the corresponding author. 
Authors should briefly explain why the work is considered appropriate 
for Scientific Reports. Authors are asked to suggest the names and 
contact information for scientific reviewers and they may request the 
exclusion of certain referees. Please ensure that your cover letter 
also includes suggestions for Editorial Board Members[1] who 
would be able to handle your submission. Finally, authors 
should indicate whether they have had any prior discussions with a 
Scientific Reports Editorial Board Member about the work 
described in the manuscript.
