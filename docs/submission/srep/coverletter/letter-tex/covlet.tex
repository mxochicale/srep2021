\opening{Dear Editor Richard White,}

%* The affiliation and contact information of your corresponding author
I have the pleasure of sending you the manuscript entitled 
"Recurrence Quantification Analysis of Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction Activities"
authored by Miguel Xochicale and Chris Baber from the University of Birmingham to be considered for publication as a research article in your prestigious journal.

%* A brief explanation of why the work is appropriate for Scientific Reports
Our work is appropriate for Scientific Reports due to its alignment to the principles of open science (e.g., reproducibility, transparency, reusability and open accessibility) in the fields of physical, biological, health and engineering sciences.
Similarly, we choose Scientific Reports as venue for publication of multidisciplinary areas where potential interest of readers may be interested and spark collaborations of our work.

Our manuscript contains original research and has not been submitted or published earlier in any journal and is not being considered for publication elsewhere.   
Authors have seen and approved the manuscript and have contributed significantly to it.

%* The names and contact information of any reviewers you consider suitable
%* The names of any referees you would like excluded from reviewing
Finally, we think that two suitable reviewers for our work would be: 
Bedartha Goswami, bedartha.goswami@uni-tuebingen.de, at University of TÃ¼bingen, for his investigation in nonlinear time series analysis and recurrence plots; 
and Serhiy Yanchuk, yanchuk@math.tu-berlin.de, at Technical University of Berlin, for his research in dynamics time delay networks of dynamical systems, pattern formation, and coupled systems.  

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
