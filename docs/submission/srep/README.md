# Scientific Reports

## Aims & scope
Scientific Reports publishes original research in all areas of the natural 
and clinical sciences. We believe that if your research is scientifically 
valid and technically sound then it deserves to be published and made 
accessible to the research community.

By publishing with us, your research will get the coverage and attention it 
deserves. Open access and continuous online publication means your work will 
be published swiftly, ready to be accessed by anyone, anywhere, at any time. 
Article Level Metrics allow you to follow the conversations your work has 
started.

## Peer review

Each manuscript is handled by an Editorial Board Member, and most submissions 
are peer reviewed by one or more referees in addition to the Editorial Board 
Member. The Editorial Board — composed of practising scientists from all 
fields within the journal's scope — manages the peer review process, 
and decides whether a paper should be accepted for publication.

The aim of the peer review process is to establish the technical soundness 
of a submission, and uses a template approach. Referees and Editorial 
Board Members will determine whether a paper is scientifically valid, 
rather than making judgements on significance or whether the submission 
represents a conceptual advance.


## Fast decision and publication times
Scientific Reports endeavours to make first decisions on manuscripts within 
45 days. After acceptance, papers are immediately processed, 
and published on a daily basis.
