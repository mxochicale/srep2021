# Guidelines

Scientific Reports publishes original research in one format, Article. 
In most cases we do not impose strict limits on word count or page number. 
We do, however, strongly encourage authors to write concisely and to adhere 
to the guidelines below.

Articles should ideally be no more than 11 typeset pages in length. 
As a guide, the main text (not including Abstract, Methods, References 
and figure legends) should be no more than 4,500 words. 


## Suggested structure

* Introduction
* Results (with subheadings)
* Discussion (without subheadings)
* Methods

## figues/tables

* Figure legends are limited to 350 words. 

* We suggest that Articles contain no more than 8 display 
items (figures and/or tables).
