# Guidelines for publication of code and data
* [Guidelines for Code Publication](GuidelinesCodePublication.pdf) by nature is a good referecen to tidy up code and data for the publication of the manuscript. 

## Notes.
I have not done an extensive search for further reference on guidance for publication but [Guidelines for Code Publication](GuidelinesCodePublication.pdf) by nature presents various points that have been addressed in the current manuscript.
