# TODO

## use absolute paths

As the code was part of my thesis, some paths needs to be refactored:
```
1. Generate aligned data with `/A_mscripts/A_rawData_TO_TimeAlignedDataForSeparateActivities15_p01_to_p22_octave_linux.m`
which creates this output path:
`/home/map479/tmp/phdtmpdata/time_aligned_different_length_data_for_separate_activities_p01_to_p22_octave_linux`
```


```

~/tmp/phdtmpdata/outcomes/preProcessedDataTable_p01_to_p22 
```
